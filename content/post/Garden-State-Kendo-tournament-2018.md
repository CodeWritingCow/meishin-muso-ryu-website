We participated Saturday in the 2018 Garden State Kendo Tournament. Every year, this excellent tournament attracts competitors from New York to Canada.

## Team Shudokan
Students of Meishin Muso Ryu competed as well. We formed a team under our kendo dojo's name, Shudokan Dojo. Here our team members pose for a group photo.

## Making friends
Kendo tournaments are a great place to meet old friends and make new ones. Here, **Zahn Kenon** of Baltimore-Annapolis Kendo Dojo discusses Kendo with us during lunch break. Zahn and another member of his dojo joined our team just a couple weeks ago at the Keystone Goodwill Kendo Tournament in Exton, PA.

Indeed, when **Shuji Matsushita sensei** spoke at the Keystone tournament, he asked all the competitors to make at least two new friends.

## Until next year
This year's GSK Tournament took place on Saturday, April 28, 2018, at the City Sports on 4 complex in Englewood, NJ.

It was organized by <a href='https://gs-kendo.com' target="_blank">Garden State Kendo (GSK)</a> of Palisades Park, NJ. GSK graciously hosted an afterparty with excellent Korean food.

We look forward to another GSK tournament next year.
